							<h2>Requirement</h2>
								<p>Design a advertisement that wraps an ad around an entire city bus with specific focus on typography. In this moving medium, you'll need to think about the readability of your text and its ability to make a product seem exciting. Use Illustrator's various type tools to set the ad copy. Employ a clipping mask to constrain the ad design to the exact bus shape.
								</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								A mobile ad should be visually compelling and all of the text and visual elements, should be easy to make out. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								I have attempted to make good use of the available space with something to see from front to back. I goal was to not only get the ad noticed but make it stand out from the typical visual distractions of an urban environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Text is styled and sized so it's easy to read. Plus, there's not a lot of text which is good for an ad that's on the move.
