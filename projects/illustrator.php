							<h2>Requirement</h2>
								<p>Design a advertisement that wraps an ad around an entire city bus with specific focus on typography. In this moving medium, you'll need to think about the readability of your text and its ability to make a product seem exciting. Use Illustrator's various type tools to set the ad copy. Employ a clipping mask to constrain the ad design to the exact bus shape.
								</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								A mobile ad should be visually compelling and all of the text and visual elements, should be easy to make out. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								I have attempted to make good use of the available space with something to see from front to back. I goal was to not only get the ad noticed but make it stand out from the typical visual distractions of an urban environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Text is styled and sized so it's easy to read. Plus, there's not a lot of text which is good for an ad that's on the move.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Create a robot with dimension and detail using a range of basic shape and line tools. 
								Demonstrate a knowledge of stacking order through shape and line arrangement. 
								Use solid color fills, gradient fills, and/or pattern fills to add variety to your robot design.</p>
							
							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Drawing tools and Color in Illustrator are the basic tools that serve as the foundation for illustrations ranging from simple cartoon-like drawing tools to technically complex illustrations. 
								<br/>
								I rely on these tools to start almost any illustration rather than create something from scratch with freeform drawing tools.
							</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Created a robot that could take your icecream order & deliver - Ms. Polly, An IceCream Hostess & fleet (duplicates)</li>
									<li>Used the Gradient tools - Food Category - icecream swatch for the colors. </li>
									<li>Highlighted them with Spectrum gradients.</li>
									<li>Used all the basic shapes to create robot. Layered them with slight shades to give depth to the figure.</li>
									<li>Used the patterns gradient for the bolts and the skirt</li>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
								<p>The Metropolitan Zoo has contacted you to create a postcard to advertise their new petting zoo for children. 
									<br/>
									Use your imagination, plus the transformation and distortion tools to come up with at least three creatures to be used in their marketing campaign.
								</p>
								<p>
									Base all three creatures just within the realm of the real world, and since the images must appeal to children, don't go too crazy with fangs and claws
									—that wouldn't be something I'd like to pet!  
								</p>
							<h2>Summary</h2>
								<p>Combining the knowledge of transformations and distortions with trusty drawing tools to create the postcard with three animals.
								</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Designed the playful Chicks, a Rooster and a Rabbit. The monkey is the Zoo Mascot, so it need to be on the postcard too :) </li>
									<li>Used the Scallop and Bloat tool, to illustrator all the animals. My go to tool was the wrap tool</li>
									<li>Used the Blob tool and the Swirl tool to draw the Rooster.</li>
									<li>Added a Safari border to the postcard to make it look adventurous to the kids.</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
								<p>Accurately trace the contours of a given photo with the Pen tool to create a stylized vector image.
									<br/>
									Use both smooth and corner points, and the Convert Anchor Point tool, to produce clean lines and curves.
									<br/>
									Create an image containing smooth, closed shapes (no jagged edges) filled with black or white as appropriate to mimic the provided photo  
								</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used the Pen tool to create a vector image based on a bitmap image</li>
									<li>Captured the contours of the image</li>
									<li>Created Pen tool curves as well as straight lines to mimic the shapes in the original image</li>
									<li>Used multiple layers to keep Pen tool tracings organized</li>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
								<p>A music company has assigned you the task of designing CD covers for two upcoming compilation releases. The client would prefer to retain a few common elements between the two designs as they are part of a related series of releases. The imagery you evoke with these designs can range from smooth and sultry to bright and brassy—the choice is yours.
								</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Created a theme for a Music Dance Collection for 1960’s-80’s and 1990-2010 to make the CD Covers</li>
									<li>The common thread is the 3 strands with the flare tool on it. The belt buckle which looks like a pear with a star in the middle is the same on both covers</li>
									<li>Used the Width tool to create the rug on both</li>
									<li>Used the Brush tool to draw the freeform bell bottom pants on CD 1</li>
									<li>Used the trace tool to draw the pants on CD 2</li>
									<li>Used the Pattern Brush to create the belt</li>
