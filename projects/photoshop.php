							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Qantas Airlines is starting a new service, from the American Heartland to Central Australia. More specifically, flights will originate in Wichita, Kansas, and fly to Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. Create an airline advertisement that communicates an effective message with typography and imagery that touts Qantas's new Kansas to Australia service.</p>
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>Used three dominant images, one black & white photo of a farm house in Wichita, Ayers Rock in Australia and a large image of a Qantas aircraft taking you effortlessly between the two locations.
							<br/>
							Used big bold typography to deliver the message with a smooth transition of images from Land of Oz (Kansas) to Australia
							<br/>
							I wanted the readers to be thinking about the beauty of Ayers Rock and Australia and how comfortable it is to get on a Qantas direct flight to enjoy a new vacation. </p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used layer masks and gradient masks</li>
									<li>Used various techniques for Type on the ad</li>
									<li>Point type for headline,  Area type (for longer blocks of text), Drop Shadow, Path on a warped type, and Masked Type</li>
									<li>Chose typography (color, size, effects, alignment, placement) that is appealing to the eye, appropriate to the ad, and in contrast with the background for readability</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Murano - Venice is a beautiful town with specialities in glass art, its canals and multi-colored houses. This poster invites photography enthusiasts to join a photosafari tour.
								<br/><br/>
								I have depicted the colorful houses, its glass creations. Enhanced the canal and boats to make them come alive. Added glass birds and glass horse, which represents that place.
								Also created a little drama to the glass horse using smoke, which shows how it might look right out of the furnace. Camera lens rises from the horizon drawing attention to the fact that this is a tour for photography enthusiasts</p>
							
							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used seven images - colorful houses, horse, birds, clouds, lens, title, photosafari, ZeroHour Tours</li>
									<li>Removed, people from the pavement using Clone-stamp.</li>
									<li>Added mask to remove the sky from background and replace with a cloudy sky</li>
									<li>Added duplicated layers for the horse, birds and Canal area.</li>
									<li>Applied filters to all of them, making them more prominent and color saturated</li>
									<li>The title text Murano and the birds are tucked behind the buildings. The text used color scheme from one of the houses. Used a gradient to the bottom of the picture to make words ‘photo safari’ stand out.</li>
								</ul>
