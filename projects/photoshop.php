							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Qantas Airlines is starting a new service, from the American Heartland to Central Australia. More specifically, flights will originate in Wichita, Kansas, and fly to Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. Create an airline advertisement that communicates an effective message with typography and imagery that touts Qantas's new Kansas to Australia service.</p>
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>Used three dominant images, one black & white photo of a farm house in Wichita, Ayers Rock in Australia and a large image of a Qantas aircraft taking you effortlessly between the two locations.
							<br/>
							Used big bold typography to deliver the message with a smooth transition of images from Land of Oz (Kansas) to Australia
							<br/>
							I wanted the readers to be thinking about the beauty of Ayers Rock and Australia and how comfortable it is to get on a Qantas direct flight to enjoy a new vacation. </p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used layer masks and gradient masks</li>
									<li>Used various techniques for Type on the ad</li>
									<li>Point type for headline,  Area type (for longer blocks of text), Drop Shadow, Path on a warped type, and Masked Type</li>
									<li>Chose typography (color, size, effects, alignment, placement) that is appealing to the eye, appropriate to the ad, and in contrast with the background for readability</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Masking images opens up a lot of possibilities for creating eye-catching images for graphic design projects like advertising and marketing. Put your masking skills to the test, along with some image blending as well, integrating multiple iterations of the same person into a single image. I like to call it... multiplicity.</p>
							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Your client is working on an article about multitasking: doing many different tasks with little time and few resources. To supplement that article, you are tasked with creating a multiple image of yourself or someone else, with at least four iterations in the same scene doing any task you choose.</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>To create a successful multiplicity image, I used the same background image for a sequence of separate photographs. The subject (person) was then moved around to occupy a different area within the same scene.</li>
									<li>Used masking techniques and create a story with the same subject interacting with himself.</li>
									<li>Used a tripod and took the photos within 5 minutes to keep the shadows consistent.</li>
									<li>Also selected a background without any moving elements so that the alignment of the shots is easy and unnoticeable.</li>
									<li>Created a "multiplicity" image containing six instances of the same person and telling a story with the instances' interactions.</li>
									<li>Created painted layer masks and manage layers effectively.</li>
									<li>Applied additional masking/blending technique to enhance the image: masking to adjust the background, blending to replace a background element.</li>
									<li>Added a gradient mask to fade the image into a related solid color</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Murano - Venice is a beautiful town with specialities in glass art, its canals and multi-colored houses. This poster invites photography enthusiasts to join a photosafari tour.
								<br/><br/>
								I have depicted the colorful houses, its glass creations. Enhanced the canal and boats to make them come alive. Added glass birds and glass horse, which represents that place.
								Also created a little drama to the glass horse using smoke, which shows how it might look right out of the furnace. Camera lens rises from the horizon drawing attention to the fact that this is a tour for photography enthusiasts</p>
							
							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used seven images - colorful houses, horse, birds, clouds, lens, title, photosafari, ZeroHour Tours</li>
									<li>Removed, people from the pavement using Clone-stamp.</li>
									<li>Added mask to remove the sky from background and replace with a cloudy sky</li>
									<li>Added duplicated layers for the horse, birds and Canal area.</li>
									<li>Applied filters to all of them, making them more prominent and color saturated</li>
									<li>The title text Murano and the birds are tucked behind the buildings. The text used color scheme from one of the houses. Used a gradient to the bottom of the picture to make words ‘photo safari’ stand out.</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>One of the most powerful uses of Photoshop, aside from fooling the eye, digitally placing people in places where they've never been in reality, is developing "key art" for movie posters.</p>
							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Create a movie poster showcasing a fictional film.  You must use a photo of yourself in some way, to anchor this poster. </p>
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>Located images of famous stars, city shots and other images to support the story line, which is imaginary.  Katy Perry is a famous singer who is attacked  by her pet tiger, that gets possessed by a ghost that is haunting that city. I know, its sound crazy, but had to built a story based on my pictures :) The story is how she makes fights back.</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Combined five different images into a single piece of "key art" using image import techniques and layer management techniques.</li>
									<li>Used opacity controls in the Layers panel as a means of blending the images.</li>
									<li>Used selection techniques, including Pen tool work paths, to make accurate selections of the imagery.</li>
									<li>Used the Clone Stamp tool to show reflection on sun glasses.</li>
									<li>Used Free Transform to scale and rotate layers.</li>
									<li>Refined edges and/or add Drop Shadow effects to enhance the smoothness and realism of the composition.</li>
									<li>Desaturated the colors a bit so the images would feel like they were from a similar source.</li>
									<li>Compiling these, with good layering and opacity adjustments, creates depth and visual interest.</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Create the cover of a DVD for a favorite old movie. Combine at least two photographs and demonstrate various brush techniques. You will need black and white photos to get started.</p>
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>Colorized the images of Bergman and Bogart as well as the globe intentionally to convey that the movie is re-mastered in color. Also left the scene at the cafe in black and white to show the transition from a B&W to color.</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used a preset smoke brush and stamping technique to give a nostalgic effect.</li>
									<li>Image colorization of source photographs</li>
								</ul>
