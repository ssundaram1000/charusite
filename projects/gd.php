							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Italian olive oil maker Olivio has commissioned a design for a series of three new flavored olive oil products. The manufacturer has been around for centuries, but wants a new label to appear on this "brand extension." The company has chosen you to break new ground and reinvent the brand.
							</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Research your project and obtain three identical bottles.</li>
									<li>Design labels for three flavors of olive oil, considering the shape of the bottles and coherence of elements.</li>
									<li>Create labels and neck booklets that show your bottles are part of the same product line yet distinct items.</li>
									<li>Print and apply the labels, neck booklet, and cap treatments to the bottles.</li>
									<li>Photograph your final product, following the guidelines of a professional studio shoot.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								Found the right bottle and worked to pair the bottle and label style. Focussed on consistency and endured that the design is easily adaptable for additional flavors. This will help the brand expand with relative ease. 								
							</p>
							<p>
								Used a pattern; which helps tie the label and hang tag together. The gold twine is used to pair with the door of the oil and provided contrast against the dark texture on the label and tag.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Design the magazine cover combining your logo, cover image, and story titles.</li>
								<li>Research various magazine designs and the "one message rule."</li>
								<li>Create a two-page story spread based on the feature article of your cover. Use a standard grid to position images and text on the spread. </li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>
								My cover design makes good use of depth and utilizes the space available to sell the magazine. I used a Katy Perry and JJ Watt photos with a focus on Superbowl. Focussed on keeping the title and subtitles special and clean tying them to the Superbowl and Fashion.
								</p><p>
								The use of color provides good contrast and focussed on creating a clear article hierarchy. I also made room for the UPC code and utilize some real world functional elements (like the price and including page numbers for the main article).
								</p><p>
								On the Spread - used a cutout of Katy Perry's Cleopatra image, which makes you stop and  give it another look. The content on that page is minimal, if they are interested, they can continue to read about the designer, the fashions, cost, costumes etc. Added image of the fashion designer and a pullout quote to generate interest.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Design a poster for a touring production of Mostly Mozart that's visiting your city. Mostly Mozart is a 30-year-old classical music festival run by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York that celebrates the music of Mozart, plus a few other well-known "classical music" icons such as Beethoven, Schubert, and Haydn. The poster will display outside your town theater, and should be designed to be viewed from a distance.
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								I used a statue of Mozart, Violins and Atlanta Skyline. The focal point is the head of the statue. It is placed in the right 1/3rd of the page. The readers eyes move from the statue up towards the key information about the festival name and dates. The hand visually connects on a path through the violin to the city of Atlanta as well as the name of the venue. This creates a rhythm on the poster.							
							</p>
							<p>
								Used larger fonts to show the important text from a farther viewing distance. Balance is achieved by the smaller violin with richer color on left and the larger white statue on the right.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unity is represented in two locations, one with the full statue, which is made of many parts. In addition, I have unified the important pieces of text within the green dots.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Design a creative, attractive backstage pass for a music event that reflects effective digital imaging, good visual design, appropriate typography, and research of the theme.
							</p>
					
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								Used multiple vector drawing tools (Shape tools and the Pen tool) to create the pass background area and special ornamentation for the design. Used the Pen tool to cleanly and precisely select and extract part of a photo for use in the pass design.
 								
							</p>
							<h2>STORY</h2>
							<p>
								 For my Backstage pass, I choose a past event -  Beyonce’s “I AM World Tour” picked London as the performing city. Added symmetry to the vest images by choosing an image which will pull them together, the dotted concert image. Added a location image to the world tour by bringing in the Big Ben image.  Included Beyonce's image to showcase the artist. Used a black and white image of Tower bridge to add a little contrast in the vest. Feathered the path to make it sharp, as that is the main focus of the pass. I enjoyed creating paths with the Pen tool.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							Design a full-page magazine advertisement for a concert event, demonstrating effective, creative design techniques and research of the theme.
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>
								Selected Smooth Jazz in NY, with 2015 Jazz Masters. Added a logo of National Endowment of Arts (NEA) as they were celebrating 50 years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Placement of the NYC image within the figures is a way to get a strong recognition of the location. Unified the figures using good choice of colors and smart filters. Created a hierarchy of objects on the design using object and font sizes. The flags accent and compliment the main feature rather than taking away from it and placed them in the corner. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I got the idea from the NEA logo to create a smart linked object, drew a triangle and mainly, found a fun way to recreate the sponsor’s logo on the celebration banner. Used a textured blue triangle in the middle to pull them together. The dark purple background is a good contrast and in my opinion represents Jazz.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							Design a creative type-based logo design for a musician that captures the musical style of the artist.
							<br/>
							Incorporate the logo and other required text elements in a book cover design (front, back, spine) that demonstrates professional-level attention to typography including (but not limited to) font selection, space, kerning, leading, and tracking.


							<h2>Logo / Branding</h2>
							<p>
								Creative manipulation of the type to create a really identifiable logo. For the logo I used Prohibition Regular font and used the convert to shape tool to modify the I into a shape of a guitar, making it look like a performer and also made the letter R, look like a guitar end. Adding the metallic background gave it the heavy metal aspect i wanted to bring out in the rock band.
							</p>

							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>
								For this project to create an identity and book cover, I choose a rock band - Foo Fighters. A rock band which melds melodic elements with heavier ones. In order to redesign their logo, i choose to show their heavy metal aspect by replacing their modern script  logo and making it a heavy metallic looking one.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, in my research saw this title Learning to Fly as one of the best biographies of the band, so redesigned with a new logo and design. Continued the use of industrial fonts ( Industry Stencil for the subtitles and the authors name) to re-emphasize  the metal.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Research coffee table books of various genres.</li>
								<li>Design a book cover that features the work of a modern artist and strong typography.</li>
								<li>Design a chapter introduction page for the book that includes the artist's name, chapter title, topics, descriptive text, and images.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate an ability to combine text and images in a way that is both clear and engaging to a reader.</li>
							</ul>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								For the Coffee book, I picked David Smith, a metal Sculptor, his work in featured in MoMA, Ny. The cover image is a suspended cube, which was part of his cube series. I picked a car background with metal inside parts showing, since he attributes his experiences of working in the car body workshop as his creative process.
								</p><p>
								The placement and size of the sculpture creates depth. Black background was chosen to accentuate the metal sculpture and car parts while providing ample negative space. The subtle red stroke was added to complement the foreground. The chapter page makes good use of white space, and incorporates visuals and color to tie back to the cover.

							<br/>
							Used big bold typography to deliver the message with a smooth transition of images from Land of Oz (Kansas) to Australia

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Murano - Venice is a beautiful town with specialities in glass art, its canals and multi-colored houses. This poster invites photography enthusiasts to join a photosafari tour.
								<br/><br/>
								I have depicted the colorful houses, its glass creations. Enhanced the canal and boats to make them come alive. Added glass birds and glass horse, which represents that place.
								Also created a little drama to the glass horse using smoke, which shows how it might look right out of the furnace. Camera lens rises from the horizon drawing attention to the fact that this is a tour for photography enthusiasts</p>

							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>
								I recreated Ariana Grande's album "Yours Truly" with a colorful background, started by picking a background image of the Eiffel Tower  and creating a logo with her initials and used a image of a heart tattoo on all 3 panels to show they were from the same album and  added some sparkles and swirly paint brushes ver all 3 panels to add some embellishments. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								CD Front - Used a image of the Eiffel Tower as the background image and  used the Mixer Brush to create wet oil paint effect to the image. After i go the desired effect, inserted a cut out of the artist, Ariana Grande. I put that image in the behind the paint layer to show the background color through her image, similar to the example in the exercise.
							</p>
							<p>
								CD Middle - Used the painted Eiffel tower image as the base and added stars with the stars brush and colored 2 images and layered them. To color this, first I used the Eiffel tower image to create a theme of my project, called it Eiffel Tower Paris France. Used the colors to bring out the details in both the images of Ariana's profile and the heart shaped tattoo on a persons arm.
							</p>
							<p>
								CD Back - Used the painted Eiffel tower image as the base and added a colored background and added the text of the list of songs and other details.
