							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Italian olive oil maker Olivio has commissioned a design for a series of three new flavored olive oil products. The manufacturer has been around for centuries, but wants a new label to appear on this "brand extension." The company has chosen you to break new ground and reinvent the brand.
							</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Research your project and obtain three identical bottles.</li>
									<li>Design labels for three flavors of olive oil, considering the shape of the bottles and coherence of elements.</li>
									<li>Create labels and neck booklets that show your bottles are part of the same product line yet distinct items.</li>
									<li>Print and apply the labels, neck booklet, and cap treatments to the bottles.</li>
									<li>Photograph your final product, following the guidelines of a professional studio shoot.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								Found the right bottle and worked to pair the bottle and label style. Focussed on consistency and endured that the design is easily adaptable for additional flavors. This will help the brand expand with relative ease. 								
							</p>
							<p>
								Used a pattern; which helps tie the label and hang tag together. The gold twine is used to pair with the door of the oil and provided contrast against the dark texture on the label and tag.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Design the magazine cover combining your logo, cover image, and story titles.</li>
								<li>Research various magazine designs and the "one message rule."</li>
								<li>Create a two-page story spread based on the feature article of your cover. Use a standard grid to position images and text on the spread. </li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>
								My cover design makes good use of depth and utilizes the space available to sell the magazine. I used a Katy Perry and JJ Watt photos with a focus on Superbowl. Focussed on keeping the title and subtitles special and clean tying them to the Superbowl and Fashion.
								</p><p>
								The use of color provides good contrast and focussed on creating a clear article hierarchy. I also made room for the UPC code and utilize some real world functional elements (like the price and including page numbers for the main article).
								</p><p>
								On the Spread - used a cutout of Katy Perry's Cleopatra image, which makes you stop and  give it another look. The content on that page is minimal, if they are interested, they can continue to read about the designer, the fashions, cost, costumes etc. Added image of the fashion designer and a pullout quote to generate interest.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Plan a retro-inspired advertisement design.</li>
								<li>Use as few digital means as possible in producing the ad.</li>
								<li>Use pencil to sketch the layout on the page surface.</li>
								<li>Print and cut photos, background images, and text.</li>
								<li>Position and glue down all page elements.</li>
								<li>Scan or photograph your work and write a short commentary reflecting on your experience.</li>
							</ul>						

							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>I chose a Mom with a grocery cart & kids. The cart is full and she is enjoying a Soda pop Twirl. I exaggerated the bottle of Twirl and used tiny bottles cut outs to draw attention to the product. The mom’s approval and party drink makes it attractive to all. Used a wall paper to add to the retro effect.
							</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								The goal of this advert was to advertise a soda. This advert attempts to achieve that goal. I have tried to make it clear that the brand is Twirl and that the product is a soft drink. I also tried to clearly reinforce the brand/product relationship. The placement of the soda bottle is placed right where the eye will natural land on. I believe I have achieved the goal of the advert and at the same time gave it the retro look.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Research the design elements of current package designs.</li>
								<li>Create the die line base for a box in Illustrator. </li>
								<li>Combine elements of your research with your own ideas to create a flat box design for the Kensington Ball-in-a-Box.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate an ability to think in three dimensions, being aware of each panel as its own entity, but keeping the style cohesive with the rest of the box. </li>
								<li>Create a 3D mock-up of the box by scaling and rotating three sides of the flat box design.</li>
								<li>Print and construct the box and photograph it.</li>								
							</ul>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								The 3D box design flows seamlessly from panel to panel. The product photo assures the customer of the contents, while the bright colors against the white background helps grab people’s attention. This design helps people pick the product from the shelf and read more about it.
								</p><p>
								Repeated the use of brand and product logo to help with the recognition of the Kensington brand and the Ball in a Box product.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Research coffee table books of various genres.</li>
								<li>Design a book cover that features the work of a modern artist and strong typography.</li>
								<li>Design a chapter introduction page for the book that includes the artist's name, chapter title, topics, descriptive text, and images.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate an ability to combine text and images in a way that is both clear and engaging to a reader.</li>
							</ul>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								For the Coffee book, I picked David Smith, a metal Sculptor, his work in featured in MoMA, Ny. The cover image is a suspended cube, which was part of his cube series. I picked a car background with metal inside parts showing, since he attributes his experiences of working in the car body workshop as his creative process.
								</p><p>
								The placement and size of the sculpture creates depth. Black background was chosen to accentuate the metal sculpture and car parts while providing ample negative space. The subtle red stroke was added to complement the foreground. The chapter page makes good use of white space, and incorporates visuals and color to tie back to the cover.
