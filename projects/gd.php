							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Italian olive oil maker Olivio has commissioned a design for a series of three new flavored olive oil products. The manufacturer has been around for centuries, but wants a new label to appear on this "brand extension." The company has chosen you to break new ground and reinvent the brand.
							</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Research your project and obtain three identical bottles.</li>
									<li>Design labels for three flavors of olive oil, considering the shape of the bottles and coherence of elements.</li>
									<li>Create labels and neck booklets that show your bottles are part of the same product line yet distinct items.</li>
									<li>Print and apply the labels, neck booklet, and cap treatments to the bottles.</li>
									<li>Photograph your final product, following the guidelines of a professional studio shoot.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								Found the right bottle and worked to pair the bottle and label style. Focussed on consistency and endured that the design is easily adaptable for additional flavors. This will help the brand expand with relative ease. 								
							</p>
							<p>
								Used a pattern; which helps tie the label and hang tag together. The gold twine is used to pair with the door of the oil and provided contrast against the dark texture on the label and tag.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Design the magazine cover combining your logo, cover image, and story titles.</li>
								<li>Research various magazine designs and the "one message rule."</li>
								<li>Create a two-page story spread based on the feature article of your cover. Use a standard grid to position images and text on the spread. </li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>
								My cover design makes good use of depth and utilizes the space available to sell the magazine. I used a Katy Perry and JJ Watt photos with a focus on Superbowl. Focussed on keeping the title and subtitles special and clean tying them to the Superbowl and Fashion.
								</p><p>
								The use of color provides good contrast and focussed on creating a clear article hierarchy. I also made room for the UPC code and utilize some real world functional elements (like the price and including page numbers for the main article).
								</p><p>
								On the Spread - used a cutout of Katy Perry's Cleopatra image, which makes you stop and  give it another look. The content on that page is minimal, if they are interested, they can continue to read about the designer, the fashions, cost, costumes etc. Added image of the fashion designer and a pullout quote to generate interest.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Design a poster for a touring production of Mostly Mozart that's visiting your city. Mostly Mozart is a 30-year-old classical music festival run by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York that celebrates the music of Mozart, plus a few other well-known "classical music" icons such as Beethoven, Schubert, and Haydn. The poster will display outside your town theater, and should be designed to be viewed from a distance.
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								I used a statue of Mozart, Violins and Atlanta Skyline. The focal point is the head of the statue. It is placed in the right 1/3rd of the page. The readers eyes move from the statue up towards the key information about the festival name and dates. The hand visually connects on a path through the violin to the city of Atlanta as well as the name of the venue. This creates a rhythm on the poster.							
							</p>
							<p>
								Used larger fonts to show the important text from a farther viewing distance. Balance is achieved by the smaller violin with richer color on left and the larger white statue on the right.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unity is represented in two locations, one with the full statue, which is made of many parts. In addition, I have unified the important pieces of text within the green dots.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Research coffee table books of various genres.</li>
								<li>Design a book cover that features the work of a modern artist and strong typography.</li>
								<li>Design a chapter introduction page for the book that includes the artist's name, chapter title, topics, descriptive text, and images.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate an ability to combine text and images in a way that is both clear and engaging to a reader.</li>
							</ul>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								For the Coffee book, I picked David Smith, a metal Sculptor, his work in featured in MoMA, Ny. The cover image is a suspended cube, which was part of his cube series. I picked a car background with metal inside parts showing, since he attributes his experiences of working in the car body workshop as his creative process.
								</p><p>
								The placement and size of the sculpture creates depth. Black background was chosen to accentuate the metal sculpture and car parts while providing ample negative space. The subtle red stroke was added to complement the foreground. The chapter page makes good use of white space, and incorporates visuals and color to tie back to the cover.

							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>Used three dominant images, one black & white photo of a farm house in Wichita, Ayers Rock in Australia and a large image of a Qantas aircraft taking you effortlessly between the two locations.
							<br/>
							Used big bold typography to deliver the message with a smooth transition of images from Land of Oz (Kansas) to Australia
							<br/>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Murano - Venice is a beautiful town with specialities in glass art, its canals and multi-colored houses. This poster invites photography enthusiasts to join a photosafari tour.
								<br/><br/>
								I have depicted the colorful houses, its glass creations. Enhanced the canal and boats to make them come alive. Added glass birds and glass horse, which represents that place.
								Also created a little drama to the glass horse using smoke, which shows how it might look right out of the furnace. Camera lens rises from the horizon drawing attention to the fact that this is a tour for photography enthusiasts</p>
							
							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Used seven images - colorful houses, horse, birds, clouds, lens, title, photosafari, ZeroHour Tours</li>
									<li>Removed, people from the pavement using Clone-stamp.</li>
									<li>Added mask to remove the sky from background and replace with a cloudy sky</li>
									<li>Added duplicated layers for the horse, birds and Canal area.</li>
									<li>Applied filters to all of them, making them more prominent and color saturated</li>
									<li>The title text Murano and the birds are tucked behind the buildings. The text used color scheme from one of the houses. Used a gradient to the bottom of the picture to make words ‘photo safari’ stand out.</li>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Research the design elements of current package designs.</li>
								<li>Create the die line base for a box in Illustrator. </li>
								<li>Combine elements of your research with your own ideas to create a flat box design for the Kensington Ball-in-a-Box.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate an ability to think in three dimensions, being aware of each panel as its own entity, but keeping the style cohesive with the rest of the box. </li>
								<li>Create a 3D mock-up of the box by scaling and rotating three sides of the flat box design.</li>
								<li>Print and construct the box and photograph it.</li>								
							</ul>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								The 3D box design flows seamlessly from panel to panel. The product photo assures the customer of the contents, while the bright colors against the white background helps grab people’s attention. This design helps people pick the product from the shelf and read more about it.
								</p><p>
								Repeated the use of brand and product logo to help with the recognition of the Kensington brand and the Ball in a Box product.

							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>The extension from edge to edge divides the space in such a way that that does become the predominant principle at work here.</li>
									<li>Added lines and colors differentiate the areas. I have attached 2 images one with a  portrait &amp; landscape colored frame.  I like version 3 better.</li>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
								<p>Design a advertisement that wraps an ad around an entire city bus with specific focus on typography. In this moving medium, you'll need to think about the readability of your text and its ability to make a product seem exciting. Use Illustrator's various type tools to set the ad copy. Employ a clipping mask to constrain the ad design to the exact bus shape.
								</p>

							<h2>Techniques Used</h2>
							<p>
								A mobile ad should be visually compelling and all of the text and visual elements, should be easy to make out. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								I have attempted to make good use of the available space with something to see from front to back. I goal was to not only get the ad noticed but make it stand out from the typical visual distractions of an urban environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Text is styled and sized so it's easy to read. Plus, there's not a lot of text which is good for an ad that's on the move.
