							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>Qantas Airlines is starting a new service, from the American Heartland to Central Australia. More specifically, flights will originate in Wichita, Kansas, and fly to Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. Create an airline advertisement that communicates an effective message with typography and imagery that touts Qantas's new Kansas to Australia service.</p>
							
							<h2>Story</h2>
							<p>Used three dominant images, one black & white photo of a farm house in Wichita, Ayers Rock in Australia and a large image of a Qantas aircraft taking you effortlessly between the two locations.
							<br/>
							Used big bold typography to deliver the message with a smooth transition of images from Land of Oz (Kansas) to Australia
							<br/>
							I wanted the readers to be thinking about the beauty of Ayers Rock and Australia and how comfortable it is to get on a Qantas direct flight to enjoy a new vacation. </p>
