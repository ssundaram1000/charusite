							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Design a poster for a touring production of Mostly Mozart that's visiting your city. Mostly Mozart is a 30-year-old classical music festival run by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York that celebrates the music of Mozart, plus a few other well-known "classical music" icons such as Beethoven, Schubert, and Haydn. The poster will display outside your town theater, and should be designed to be viewed from a distance.
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								I used a statue of Mozart, Violins and Atlanta Skyline. The focal point is the head of the statue. It is placed in the right 1/3rd of the page. The readers eyes move from the statue up towards the key information about the festival name and dates. The hand visually connects on a path through the violin to the city of Atlanta as well as the name of the venue. This creates a rhythm on the poster.							
							</p>
							<p>
								Used larger fonts to show the important text from a farther viewing distance. Balance is achieved by the smaller violin with richer color on left and the larger white statue on the right.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unity is represented in two locations, one with the full statue, which is made of many parts. In addition, I have unified the important pieces of text within the green dots.

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Create a series of portraits that illustrates your understanding of open, closed, and divided negative space in three distinct compositions. Experiment with placement and cropping to achieve a harmonious balance in each composition.
							</p>

							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>The extension from edge to edge divides the space in such a way that that does become the predominant principle at work here.</li>
									<li>Added lines and colors differentiate the areas. I have attached 2 images one with a  portrait &amp; landscape colored frame.  I like version 3 better.</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Requirement</h2>
							<p>
								Using abstract shapes, create a series of compositions that represent the elements of design: unity, balance, rhythm, and proportion.Experiment with placement and cropping to achieve a harmonious balance in each composition.
							</p>
							
							<h2>TECHNIQUES USED</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Unity: </strong>Connected the four items using the film strip. Used proximity, repetition and continuation to unify the objects. Left a lot of negative space to enhance the appearance of unity.</li>
									<li><strong>Rhythm: </strong>Used repetitive and variation of objects and colors to show rhythmic movement. </li>
									<li><strong>Balance: </strong>Used symmetrical balance with equal weight images (color and overall image size) on left and right.</li>
									<li><strong>Proportion: </strong>Used the golden rectangle to focus eye on the projector. Used muted colors for the many other items on the left.</li>
								</ul>
