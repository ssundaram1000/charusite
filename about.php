						<p class="lead">A designer from Atlanta. I have graduated with a Graphic Design Professional Certificate, from the Sessions College for Professional Design.</p>
					
						<p>Every design I create, needs to have a consistent theme / idea and only then  do I focus on converting them into beautiful designs that make people happy. My design process is very hands-on and visual.</p>
